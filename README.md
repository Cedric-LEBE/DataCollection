# Data Collection for SpaceX and Other Projects

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Wrangling projects, primarily implemented using Jupyter Notebooks. The projects involve working with publicly available datasets and APIs, with a focus on the SpaceX launch data and other datasets.

## Repository Content

Below is an overview of the files present in this repository:

- `edadataviz.ipynb`: Data visualization and analysis for EDA purposes.
- `jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb`: Usage of SQL queries for data exploration on a SQLite database.
- `jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb`: Collection and analysis of SpaceX data gathered from APIs.
- `jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb`: Web scraping techniques applied to various websites to collect data.
- `lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.ipynb`: Analysis of SpaceX launch site location data.
- `labs-jupyter-spacex-Data wrangling.ipynb`: Data wrangling processes applied to SpaceX datasets.
